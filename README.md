# Text_processing
Here is a set of tools that I have found on internet.

There are 3 things in this folder.

First, is the folder called "Codigo_textem_serviuniversity". This one here is a text embeber processor. really useful for processing text (look for similar characters). this jupyter
notebook have comments for its use.

Second, There is a folder called "Otros". This one contains other tools for text processing... I just played a little bit with those, so there is not much developed here. 
However, you can check the code and have some fun with it. (I loaded two files that are in the folder, you will realize with a short look over the jupyter).

Last. Is a .rar file. This one is not really usefull, it is a personal test.
